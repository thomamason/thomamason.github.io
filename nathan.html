        <h1> FreeMcBoot and you.... </h1>
        <h2> a really goofy guide to your softmodded memory card </h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul><h3>Key points: </h3><li>ALWAYS keep this mem card in the second slot (so you don't corrupt your memory card for your saved games!)</li>
        <li>by default, this is set up to work with a usb harddrive. Use an actual harddrive (not a thumb drive) with a sata to usb cable</li>
        <li>this guide aims to get you playing games via usb harddrive on your ps2. There's loads more you can do with the software here, but we can talk about that another time. One day, I'll write a proper guide on FreeMcBoot, as the official documentation is shite/written to gatekeep newbies so the older crowd can charge for troubleshooting</li>
        </ul>>

        <h2> okay lets get into it!</h2>
        <ul> <h3>usage instructions:</h3>
        <li> to start, take your usb harddrive and plug it into a usb port on the front of your ps2. This usb harddrive should be formatted as either FAT32 or ext4</li>
        <li> once the system is booted, the drive will be populated with a file structure. The only really important folder is called 'DVD'</li>
        <li> this DVD folder is where you place your ps2 game .iso files. getting these from the web is ILLEGAL so don't do that ;)</li>
        <li> once you've added games to the DVD folder via your pc, plug the drive in, boot the console up and then navigate to games</li>
        <li> the program that loads these games is called OPL (open playstation loader) and by default it will search for the hard drive and the games in the .iso folder</li>
        <li> click to boot the game! EZ</li>
        <li> <h3> UNLESS......</h3></li>
        <li> not <i>all</i> games will load. Damn near 99%, but not all</li>
        <li> here's a compatibility list: <a href="https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/page/opl-game-compatibility-list-1"> ps2-home compatibility list</a></li>
        </ul>

        <ul><h2> gamepad emulation</h2>
        <li> i have enabled gamepad emulation for the 1st player by default. you can plug in a DS3 or DS4 game pad into the other usb slot and it should work right out of the box</li>
        <li> some games really don't like pad ehulation, so if a game won't load, go to options in OPL (triangle button, i think) and disable pademu</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <h3> enjoy pal. You can ask me anythinghyou need about this anytime. If you need a harddrive hookup, let's talk</h3>
