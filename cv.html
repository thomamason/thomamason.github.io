<p>
    I have over 10 years of experience working in hospitality and events production and management. Since moving to Manchester in 2012, 
    I have been working freelance and by contract with live music venues and bars to provide events and food/drink service to a high standard of quality.
     My extensive experience in these fields has engendered a passion for curating professional events for a range of occasions. In my personal time,
     I have a passion for IT and computing, fixing old laptops and computers and either selling them on for profit or donating them to local charities that assist the elderly with technology.</p>
